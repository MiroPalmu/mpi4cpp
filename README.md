# MPI2++
----

Crazy (weekend) project to make a header-only version of the boost::mpi for modern C++-14/17 & newest MPI versions.


## Refs / Notes

All kudos go to boost::mpi.

My hope is that by dropping compiler support of all the ancient C++ versions one can greatly simplify the boost::mpi and MPI interfaces.


## Current implementation

- [x] mpi environment 
- [ ] communicators
- [ ] blocking communication
- [ ] non-blocking
- [ ] advanced serialization & optimization
- [ ] collectives
